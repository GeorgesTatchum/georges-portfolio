# My Portfolio (Next js with nodemailer)

This is my portfolio based on Nextjs 14 and Nodemailer for contact form applying and auto response.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
